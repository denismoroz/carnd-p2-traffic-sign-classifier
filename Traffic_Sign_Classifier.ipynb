If additional code is required that cannot be included in the notebook, be sure that the Python code is successfully imported and included in your submission, if necessary.

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "As told above, dclasses of traffic signs that should be detected by network are not hevily depends on color. So, I, grayscalled input set and that leads to 90+% test accuracy. After adding extra convolutional layer, two dropout layers and one fully connected layers, model end up on 92-33% of test accuracy. Interesting fact happend when I experimenting with learing rate and by mistake modified sigma parameter for generating random values for weigths. I decreased it in 100 times and nework stopped to learn.\n",
